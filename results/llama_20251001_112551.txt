I'm happy to help you with summarizing the contents of the file, but I need more information. You haven't provided me with the content of the file "/home/andhe001/Jarvis/inbox/test_run.md".

Could you please paste the content of the file or provide a description of its content? That way, I can assist you in summarizing it for your journal.

Alternatively, if you don't have access to the file itself, we could try to recreate the summary based on the file name. In that case, "test_run.md" suggests that the file is related to testing and may contain notes or results from a test run.
