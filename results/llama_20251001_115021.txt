Here are the crisp bullet points of actions, commands, and follow-ups:

• Create a new directory `tmp_demo` in `~/Jarvis/` if it does not exist using `mkdir -p ~/Jarvis/tmp_demo`.
• Print "hello from python block" to the console.
• Create a new file `hello.sh` in `~/Jarvis/tmp_demo/` using HEREDOC (here document).
• Write the following bash script to `hello.sh`: 
  - `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
  - `echo "generated by heredoc"`
• Close the HEREDOC block with `SH`.
• Make `hello.sh` executable using `chmod +x ~/Jarvis/tmp_demo/hello.sh`.
• Run `~/Jarvis/tmp_demo/hello.sh`.
