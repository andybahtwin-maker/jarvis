Here's a summary of the file creation, commands to run, risks, and next actions in crisp bullets:

**Files created:**

â€¢ `hello.sh` in `~Jarvis/tmp_demo/`

**Commands to run:**

1. `echo "first block" && mkdir -p ~/Jarvis/tmp_demo`
2. `print("hello from python block")` (Note: This command is not valid in Bash, as `print()` is a Python function)
3. `cat <<'SH' > ~/Jarvis/tmp_demo/hello.sh`
4. `chmod +x ~/Jarvis/tmp_demo/hello.sh`

**Risks:**

1. The `print()` command may cause an error if not properly handled.
2. The script created using the HEREDOC method assumes a specific format, which might need to be adjusted for different use cases.

**Next actions:**

1. Replace the `print("hello from python block")` command with a valid Bash equivalent, such as `echo "hello from bash block"`
2. Test and verify that the `hello.sh` script runs correctly.
3. Review the contents of `~Jarvis/tmp_demo/hello.sh` to ensure it meets the desired functionality.
